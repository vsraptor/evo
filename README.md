### Evolution/Genetic algorithms

#### What is this ?

Here I will collect my experiments on Evolution/Genetic algorithms.

#### Example 1

First example is a Ruby program. You provide a target string and the app evolves a pool of strings until some of them match the target.
Keep in mind this is just example to understand the basic algorithm. Evolution normally does not have specific goal ;).
I have planned more elaborate and interesting examples.

#### TODO : tutorial

#### Algorithm

1. Pick two random parents (with tendency for ones that are closer to the target)
2. Mate and produce a child
3. Mutate the child-string
4. Rinse and repeat until the process produces a match.
